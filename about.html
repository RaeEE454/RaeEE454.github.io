        <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <br/>
            <p class="about-div">Hello! My name is Rae and welcome to my portfolio! I hold a B.A. in English with a Business Minor from Southeastern University.
                I served as Secretary and Treasurer for Sigma Tau Delta, Line Editor of the Sciences for The Oracle, and 
                graduated Cum Laude. 
                <p>I also volunteered at a local Lakeland church, Victory Assembly of God, as a second and
                third grade Wednesday night teacher for 2 years. 

                When I'm not working, I like to go camping, hiking, and off-roading with my friends!</p>
