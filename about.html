            <br/>
            <p>Hello! My name is Rae and I am an aspiring Software Engineer.
                My journey started in August 2022 and I have been building code ever since!
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>I currently live in Denver and work as a Tailor at Dillards. Outside of Dillard's,
                I'm typing out some coding projects, one of which is this very website. I have 
                worked with HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript, and have also started working with
                backend development. I have just started learning Python and SQL. If you head over to the 
                Projects page, you'll find my portfolio and also some side projects. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>When I'm not coding or working, I like to go camping, hiking, and off-roading with 
                my boyfriend and friends! 
            </p>
