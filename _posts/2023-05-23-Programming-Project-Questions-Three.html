A look back on a Python project and how I resolved issues and bugs.

<div class="container">
	<p>This little project was the product of a quick "Back-end Projects" search on Youtube. It was very categorical, and took a little bit of trial and error.  I wanted the project to be fun so I decided to use one of my favorite movies , “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.” And since I was writing in Python, I thought it fitting. This was before I found out that Guido van Rossum named it from “Monty Python’s Flying Circus.” </p>
	
		<p>Now the last time I touched this code was over 2 months ago. I remember it working properly but when I returned to it today, I found it not working whatsoever. I was typing the correct answer for the first question which was “Assur.” It was saying this was incorrect even though it was.  What I had to do was insert the else statement and swap the printed message which indicated whether the answer was right or wrong like so:  
However, a new problem has arisen and no matter what the user enters, its correct. I need a break and will return to this.</p>
