A project using React and PostgreSQL! I currently work as a tailor and have recorded customer information 
using physical copies of paperwork. As this has taken up space, a question I asked myself was this: How would I store my customer's
alterations information?

    <p>The answer to this question is simple! Create a database with PostgreSQL and use React as the front-end!</p>
    <p>However, while answering the question was simple, building the idea was less than so. I had created
        small projects with React and PostgreSQL separately, but I lacked the knowledge to combine them.  
    </p>
    <p>But thankfully, we live in the age of the internet, and through various Youtube tutorials and advice from friends, 
        I have a working Alterations Database! I deployed it to Vercel and activated their login security feature. 

    </p>
    <p>Sidenote: the project is ongoing and I am currently working on creating a searchbar.
    </p>
    <h2>The Big Takeaway:</h2>
    <p>I proved to myself that I can create a beneficial project to my current line of work. I have the determination to make an idea a 
        reality, and I found that I also enjoyed it! Yes, I shed blood, sweat, and tears, but it was worth it.
