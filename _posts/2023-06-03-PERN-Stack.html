I created a directory and installed npx...etc.. inside of it and followed the Next.Js tutorial. I created and inserted various elements such as Head, Link, Script, and Layout. 
I learned that this element allows us to insert third party Javascript scripts. I did have one issue happen when I inserted it into my file. I insert Script …. and nothing happened in the console. 
I double-checked spelling, syntax… Everything seemed fine. Well, I had someone else look at it and I had placed Script inside of Head.  I was supposed to place it after the Head element.

Continued to follow the Next Js course. Learned about getStaticProps() which is used for data fetching. This function returns props which Next Js uses to pre-rend at build time.  I’ve seen this around some projects I’ve surfed and made a mental note of it. 
I can choose how I want to render my pages. Next Js has 2 forms, Static Generation and Server-side Rendering. I will need to learn more about rendering in the coming days.

Had some trouble center the “Create Ticket” button and the “Submit Ticket” button. I had realized that I was applying global styles to both and only needed to apply certain styles at the component level. I adjusted the layout.module.css.

Created server dir and installed express, cors, and pg. Set up a pool to manage my database connections. Got started with creating a route however, I’m a little new to async/await. Right now, I believe async is used to send an asynchronious request which is a request sent while other code is running and is designed to keep things streamlined and not hold up other scripts. Can’t have your app pausing when sending a req
