Greetings! My very first blog post!

<!--more-->

<div class="container">
    <p>Hello World! This is my first blog post for my website! Thanks to Jekyll, I can now post my adventures in programming and off-roading. I’m not sure what else I’ll include but I hope you follow along on my journey!</p>
        <h4>What To Expect</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Reviewing code and what went wrong. Let’s see what’s under the hood!
            </li>
            <li>What I learned from a tutorial or debugging.
            </li>
            <li>My Jeep getting stuck in the mud!</li>
        </ul>
    <br />
    <p>I want this website to grow along with me. I may not share every single little project I do, but I want to include most or at least something different than what I’ve done before. Hope to see you around!
        Happy Reading</p>
