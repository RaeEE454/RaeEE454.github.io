Greetings! My very first blog post!

<!--more-->

<div class="container">
    <p> Thanks to Jekyll, I can now post my adventures in programming and off-roading. I’m not sure what else I’ll include but I hope you follow along on my journey!
        You can expect to read about my projects and how I solved bugs. You may find a blog post about what I learned about data structures. 
        I may not share every single little project I do, but I want to include most or at least something different than what I’ve done before. Hope to see you around!
        Happy Reading!
    </p>
