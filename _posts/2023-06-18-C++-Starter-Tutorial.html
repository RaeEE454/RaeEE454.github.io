A step-by-step guide to creating a C++ file within the Linux terminal.

    <p class="about-div">Picture this: You've been using a code editor to create and run your projects. The code editor? Visual Studio Code. However, you want a challenge. Maybe something not as 
        visually appealing, no effort into GUI whatsoever. That's where the terminal comes in. The terminal has a command line where
        you sit in the cockpit of your computer. It can be daunting for newcomers who are used to an app or website editor. But like you said before, you want a  challenge.  
    </p>
    <p class="about-div">This tutorial will step you through the process of creating a C++ file within the Linux terminal. This is not designed to teach the C++ language itself; rather, it is designed to apply
        a basic understanding of C++ and your terminal.

    <h4>At-A-Glance C++ Facts</h4>
    <p><h5>Fact #1:</h5>C++ is one of the most widely-used programming languages.</p>
    <p><h5>Fact #2:</h5>Your computer understands 0s and 1s, known as binary. To translate your code
        into something your computer understands, you will need a compiler which for Linux is GNU. Learn more about compilers <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/c-compiler-explained-what-is-the-compiler-and-how-do-you-use-it/">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p><h5>Fact #3:</h5>You can use C++ to gain more control of system resources and memory.</p>
    <p><h5>Fact #4:</h5>You'll come across an executable file. This is a sharable file compatible across systems. </p>

    <h4>Let's Get Started!</h4>
    <p><h5>Step 1:</h5> Create a new directory. You may title it however you like.</p>

    <br />
    <p><h5>Step 2:</h5>Navigate to directory.</p>
    <div><img src="/Images/step2.png"></div>
    <br />
    <p><h5>Step 3:</h5>Make sure you have GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) installed. You will need this to run your C++ code. To install, click <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/">here.</a></p>
    <div><img src="/Images/step3versioncheck.png"></div>
    <br />
    <p><h5>Step 4:</h5>Confirm GCC is installed successfully.</p>

    <br />
    <p><h5>Step 5:</h5>Create your file and insert your code. Here is a VIM <a href="https://sites.radford.edu/~mhtay/CPSC120/VIM_Editor_Commands.htm">cheatsheet</a> to help you navigate.</p>
    <div><img src="/Images/step5createfile.png"></div>
    <p> You will see a blank screen. Press a key such as "a" to start writing.</p>
    <div><img src="/Images/vim code.png"></div>
    <p>Save by pressing esc and :w. Exit by pressing esc and :x.</p>
    <br />
    <p><h5>Step 6:</h5>Once you have finished with your code, compile your file. Nothing will appear after you press enter.</p>
    <div><img src="/Images/step5compiler.png"></div>
    <br /> 
    <p><h5>Step 7:</h5>You can list your executable files with the command $ ls -ltr.</p>
    <div><img src="/Images/list executable files.png"></div>
    <br />
    <p><h5>Step 8:</h5> You can run your file by entering the command $ ./a.out.</p>
    <div><img src="/Images/runfile step.png"></div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h4>There You Have It!</h4>
    <br />
    <p>You have successfully created a C++ file in your Linux terminal! You are now ready to conquer the world with your new found skills! </p>
