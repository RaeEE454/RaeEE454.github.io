Today, I wanted to work with C++. I wanted to work entirely within
        the terminal and only use VIM.

        Why? Because it'd be something different. 
        I really like working within the terminal and working with "bare-bones"
        utilities (no GUI)....and code editors (vim, anyone?). I focus better with the terminal mainly due to the 
        minimalizism. I guess for now it works. I haven't worked on projects or processes
        that contain hundreds of files or thousands of lines of code. But for now, it works.
        And I wanted to work with C++ to challenge myself

        The project I worked on created a c++ file that displayed system information, such as
        Hostname and Date/time. I used the system() function and echo command. I followed a tutorial on 
        eduonix and here is the code I followed:

    <p>It was a lot of fun! I got to practice creating files in Linux, compiling those files,
        and writing code in C++. I'm not sure what my next C++ project will be, maybe a game 
        or decision maker. We'll see.
